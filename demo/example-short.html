<p><b style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Population Density</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Isabela
 City has 45 barangays, 19 of which are classified as urban and 26 as 
rural. Population is heavily concentrated in the urban areas and its 
vicinity leaving a relatively sparsely populated hinterland. The 
concentration of the people has been in the town proper but it is 
currently showing evidences of spreading towards the eastern and western
 side of the poblacion. Data on Population Density by Barangay, 2010 
indicate the unbalanced distribution of the townâ€™s population.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Isabela
 City exhibits that the population concentration is within the town 
center. This means that barangays located nearest to the center where 
the Public Market is located is likely to be the most densely populated 
area. The urban barangays of Kaumpurnah Zone I, Kaumpurnah Zone 
III,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaumpurnah Zone II, Marketsite,&nbsp; 
Riverside&nbsp; and Port Area exhibited the highest population 
concentration in terms of inhabitants per square kilometer. Barangay 
Menzi exhibits the less dense population. Although it has the biggest 
area among the urban barangays, its area can no longer be developed for 
urban expansion because large part of the area is under the 
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. In the rural area, Carbon shows 
the highest density with 14,043 people per square kilometer while 
Barangay Kapayawan has the lowest build-up density of 21 people per 
square kilometer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 12pt;"><b>Labor Force</b></span></p>

Workers recorded. The highest number of overseas workers belongs to the 
group of people who either attained or completed Elementary with 510 or 
41.03% of the total workers population, followed by the people who 
either reached or completed High school, with 280 or 22.53%. People with
 No Grade Completed ranked third with 196 workers. College Undergraduate
 and Academic Degree Holder contributed only a figure of 85 and 31 
overseas workers respectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 12pt;">People

 325 persons or 26.15%. Age range of 25-29 has the second highest people

belongs to the age group 20-24 with Elementary Education, 106 of them 
attained 1st-4th grade and 90 attained 5th-7th grade.&nbsp; This shows 
that people with high level of educational attainment prefer to work 
within the locality than those with low educational attainment, who seek
 their chances abroad.</span></p>
