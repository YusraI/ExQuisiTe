ExQuisiTe is a system to align quantity mentions in the text with related quantity mentions in tables, and enable
extractive summarization that considers table contents. ExQuisiTe links quantity mentions in the text with quantities in tables,
to support user-friendly exploration. ExQuisiTe handles exact single-cell references as well as rounded or
truncated numbers and aggregations such as row or column totals. 
ExQuisiTe is web-based developed with Django and JQuery.
